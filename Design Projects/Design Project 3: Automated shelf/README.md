### ðŸ—„ Design Project 3: Automated Shelf Design

This prototype was designed with indiviudals who have upper limb extremities and the elderly in mind. This ocntraption will allow for them to access un reachable areas on high up shelves through the use of a sensors which detects hand movements to control the output motor actuators which lower the shelf and will retract back up when the user activates the sensor once again, storing it back in its compartment.

Here is a video explaining its purpose and demonstration:
